## API Keys

All API requests must include an API key in the Authorization header.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

  <Step title="Create New Key">
    Click "Generate New API Key" and give it a name

</Steps>

## Using API Keys

### cURL Example
```bash
curl https://api.cryptotally.xyz/v1/wallets \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ct_live_abc123xyz..."
```

### JavaScript Example
```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.cryptotally.xyz/v1/wallets', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer ct_live_abc123xyz...'
  }
});
```

### Python Example
```python
import requests

headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer ct_live_abc123xyz...'
}

response = requests.get('https://api.cryptotally.xyz/v1/wallets', headers=headers)
```

## Key Types

| Type | Prefix | Environment | Use Case |
|------|--------|-------------|----------|
| Live | `ct_live_` | Production | Production applications |
| Test | `ct_test_` | Development | Testing and development |

<Note>
  Test keys only work with test mode data and won't affect your production wallets.
</Note>

## Security Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep Keys Secret">
    Never commit API keys to version control or expose them in client-side code.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Environment Variables">
    Store API keys in environment variables or secret management systems.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rotate Keys Regularly">
    Generate new keys periodically and revoke old ones.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Minimal Permissions">
    Create separate keys for different applications with appropriate scopes.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Key Permissions

Configure what each API key can access:

- **Read-only**: View wallets and transactions (recommended for dashboards)
- **Read-Write**: View and modify tags, notes, attachments
- **Full Access**: All operations including exports and webhooks

## Revoking Keys

If a key is compromised:

1. Go to API Keys page
2. Click the üóëÔ∏è icon next to the key
3. Confirm revocation
4. Update your applications with a new key

<Warning>
  Revoking a key immediately invalidates all requests using that key.
</Warning>
