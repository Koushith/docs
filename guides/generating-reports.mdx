## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Export is taking too long">
    - Large date ranges (1+ years) may take 30-60 seconds
    - Try breaking into smaller quarterly reports
    - Reduce the number of wallets/filters selected
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="CSV won't open in Excel">
    - Ensure you're using a recent version of Excel
    - Try opening with Google Sheets first
    - Check file isn't corrupted (try re-downloading)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Missing transactions in report">
    - Verify your filters aren't too restrictive
    - Check that transactions have synced (refresh wallets)
    - Ensure date range includes transaction date
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Fiat values seem incorrect">
    - CryptoTally uses historical prices at transaction time
    - Price data comes from CoinGecko API
    - For very old transactions, data may be estimated
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<Card title="Regular Exports" icon="calendar-check">
  Export your data monthly instead of waiting for tax season. This makes it easier to catch errors early.
</Card>

<Card title="Consistent Tagging" icon="tags">
  Tag transactions before exporting. Untagged transactions make reports less useful for tax categorization.
</Card>

<Card title="Backup Your Data" icon="cloud-arrow-down">
  Download annual exports and store securely. This protects against data loss.
</Card>

<Card title="Document Assumptions" icon="note">
  Add notes explaining unusual transactions before generating reports for accountants.
