## Overview

CryptoTally uses **read-only wallet tracking**, meaning you only need to provide wallet addresses - no private keys or transaction signing required. This makes it safe and easy to track any wallet, including multi-sigs and organizational treasuries.

## Supported Chains

CryptoTally currently supports the following blockchain networks:

  </Step>

## Wallet Labels

Labels help you organize multiple wallets. Common label examples:

- **Treasury** - Main organizational funds
- **Payroll** - Employee payment wallet
- **Operations** - Day-to-day expenses
- **Personal** - Individual wallet
- **Client A** - Project-specific wallet

## Managing Multiple Wallets

### Adding Multiple Chains

You can add the same wallet address across different chains. For example:

```
0x1234...5678 - Ethereum (Label: Treasury)
0x1234...5678 - Polygon (Label: Treasury - Polygon)
0x1234...5678 - Arbitrum (Label: Treasury - Arbitrum)
```

### Editing Wallet Details

To update a wallet's label:
1. Go to **Wallets** page
2. Click the ⋮ menu next to the wallet
3. Select **Edit**
4. Update the label and save

### Removing Wallets

<Warning>
  Removing a wallet will not delete transaction history or tags. Your tagged data remains accessible in the Transactions view.
</Warning>

To remove a wallet:
1. Go to **Wallets** page
2. Click the ⋮ menu next to the wallet
3. Select **Remove**
4. Confirm the action

## Wallet Privacy & Security

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is my wallet safe?">
    Yes! CryptoTally only requires your **public wallet address** - we never ask for private keys or seed phrases. This is read-only access.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can CryptoTally move my funds?">
    No. Without your private keys, it's impossible for anyone (including CryptoTally) to move funds or sign transactions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What data does CryptoTally see?">
    We fetch publicly available blockchain data: transactions, token transfers, and balances. This data is already public on the blockchain.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I track someone else's wallet?">
    Yes! Since blockchain data is public, you can track any wallet address - useful for monitoring organizational treasuries or multi-sig wallets.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Automatic Transaction Sync

Once you add a wallet, CryptoTally automatically:

- ✅ Fetches historical transactions
- ✅ Tracks token transfers (ERC-20, BEP-20, etc.)
- ✅ Records native token transfers (ETH, MATIC, BNB)
- ✅ Captures fiat values at time of transaction
- ✅ Updates balances in real-time

<Info>
  Initial sync may take 1-2 minutes for wallets with extensive transaction history (100+ transactions).
</Info>

## Workspace Context

If you're using an **organization workspace**, all team members with access can view and manage wallets based on their role:

| Role | View Wallets | Add Wallets | Edit Labels | Remove Wallets |
|------|--------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Admin | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Contributor | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Viewer | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My transactions aren't showing up">
    - Ensure you selected the correct chain
    - Wait 1-2 minutes for initial sync
    - Check that the wallet address is correct
    - Some chains may have delayed indexing
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Balance doesn't match my wallet">
    - CryptoTally shows balances for tracked tokens only
    - NFTs are not currently included in balance calculations
    - Refresh the page to fetch latest data
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I import wallets in bulk?">
    Currently, wallets must be added one at a time. Bulk import is on our roadmap.
