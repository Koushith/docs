## CryptoTally's Tax Features

### 1. Automatic Fiat Valuation
CryptoTally records the **fair market value in USD** (or your chosen currency) at the time of each transaction using historical price data.

### 2. Income Categorization
Tag transactions as:
- **Customer Payment** (Business income)
- **Salary** (W-2 or contractor income)
- **Grant** (Varies by grant type)
- **Interest/Yield** (Investment income)

### 3. Expense Tracking
Categorize deductible expenses:
- **Vendor Payment** (Business expenses)
- **Gas Fees** (Transaction costs)
- **Software/Tools** (Operating expenses)

### 4. Tax-Ready Reports
Export CSV files formatted for:
- Tax software (TurboTax, TaxAct, etc.)
- Accountant review
- IRS reporting (Schedule C, Form 8949)

## Preparing for Tax Season

### Step 1: Tag All Transactions

Before generating tax reports, ensure **all transactions are properly tagged**:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review Untagged Transactions">
    Go to **Transactions** → Filter by "Untagged"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Categorize Income">
    Tag all inflows:
    - Customer Payment
    - Salary
    - Grant
    - Interest/Yield
    - Other Income
  </Step>

  <Step title="Categorize Expenses">
    Tag all outflows:
    - Vendor Payment
    - Contractor
    - Gas Fees
    - Operating Expenses
    - Personal (if mixing personal/business)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Mark Transfers">
    Tag wallet-to-wallet transfers to avoid double-counting
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Review Fiat Values

CryptoTally automatically captures fiat values, but you should:

1. Spot-check major transactions
2. Verify values for large payments
3. Flag any suspicious values for manual review

<Tip>
  If a price seems wrong, you can manually override it in transaction details by clicking "Edit Fiat Value"
</Tip>

### Step 3: Separate Personal vs. Business

If you mix personal and business transactions:

1. Create tags: **Business** and **Personal**
2. Apply appropriate tags to all transactions
3. Generate separate reports for each

### Step 4: Reconcile Wallet Balances

Before exporting:
1. Go to **Wallets** page
2. Compare CryptoTally balances with actual wallet balances
3. Investigate any discrepancies
4. Refresh wallet sync if needed

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Not tracking every transaction** - Even small amounts are taxable
❌ **Forgetting gas fees** - These are deductible business expenses
❌ **Double-counting transfers** - Mark wallet-to-wallet moves as "Transfer"
❌ **Missing documentation** - Attach invoices and receipts
❌ **Using wrong cost basis** - Track when you acquired crypto (coming soon in CryptoTally)
❌ **Waiting until April** - Start organizing transactions throughout the year
