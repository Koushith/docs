    Click **+ New Tag**
  </Step>

  </Step>

## Tagging Transactions

### Single Transaction

1. Go to **Transactions** page
2. Click on a transaction to open details
3. Click **Add Tag** button
4. Select one or more tags from the dropdown
5. (Optional) Add a note describing the transaction
6. (Optional) Upload attachments (invoices, receipts, contracts)
7. Click **Save**

### Bulk Tagging

To tag multiple transactions at once:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Transactions">
    Check the boxes next to transactions you want to tag
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open Bulk Actions">

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Use filters to quickly find related transactions before bulk tagging (e.g., filter by token, wallet, or date range).
</Tip>

## Adding Notes

Notes provide context for transactions that tags alone can't capture.

### Example Notes:
- "Payment from Client X for Q4 2024 services"
- "Vendor payment for design work - Invoice #12345"
- "Grant disbursement - Phase 1 milestone"
- "Monthly SaaS subscription - Adobe Creative Cloud"

### Best Practices:
- ✅ Include invoice/reference numbers
- ✅ Mention client/vendor names
- ✅ Note the purpose of payment
- ✅ Reference related projects
- ❌ Avoid storing sensitive information (passwords, API keys)

## Attaching Documents

Upload up to **10 files per transaction** to keep supporting documentation organized.

### Supported File Types
- **Invoices** - PDF, DOC, DOCX
- **Receipts** - PDF, PNG, JPG
- **Contracts** - PDF

## Filtering by Tags

Once you've tagged transactions, use filters to analyze specific categories:
