## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to connect my wallet like MetaMask?">
    No! CryptoTally is **read-only**. You just paste your wallet address - no wallet connection, no signing, no risk.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which blockchains are supported?">
    Currently: Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, and BNB Chain. More chains coming soon!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How accurate are the fiat values?">
    We use CoinGecko API to fetch historical prices at the exact time of each transaction.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I track someone else's wallet?">
    Yes! Since it's read-only, you can track any public wallet address (great for monitoring DAO treasuries or public figures).
